Ingress controllers in Kubernetes play a critical role in routing external traffic into the cluster. They act as a bridge between external clients and services running within the cluster.

*What is K8S Ingress?*

K8S Ingress is an API object that manages external access to services within a cluster. It serves as a layer of abstraction for routing and load balancing of incoming HTTP and HTTPS traffic to the appropriate services based on defined rules.

𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐈𝐧𝐠𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬:

1. 𝐈𝐧𝐠𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐜𝐞: This is the configuration file that defines how traffic should be routed. It includes rules for hostnames, paths, and backend services.

2. 𝐈𝐧𝐠𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐫: The Ingress resource alone doesn't implement the routing logic. An Ingress controller, like Nginx Ingress Controller, Traefik, or HAProxy, is responsible for reading the Ingress resource and configuring the necessary routing rules in its own configuration.

*Routing External Traffic:*

1. 𝐂𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐚𝐧 𝐈𝐧𝐠𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐜𝐞: You start by creating an Ingress resource. This resource defines the rules for routing external traffic. For example:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: Ingress
  metadata:
   name: my-ingress
  spec:
   rules:
   - host: example. com
    http:
     paths:
     - path: /app
      pathType: Prefix
      backend:
       service:
        name: my-service
        port:
         number: 80
  
  This rule directs traffic coming to example. com/app to the my-service within the cluster on port 80.

2. 𝐈𝐧𝐠𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐫 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐟𝐢𝐠𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: The Ingress controller watches for changes in Ingress resources. When you create or update an Ingress resource, the controller reads it and configures itself accordingly.

3. 𝐃𝐍𝐒 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐟𝐢𝐠𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: External clients need to be able to resolve the hostname (e.g., example.com) to the cluster's external IP address. This usually involves setting up DNS records to point to your cluster's load balancer or external service.

4. 𝐋𝐨𝐚𝐝 𝐁𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐢𝐧𝐠: External traffic often comes through a load balancer or reverse proxy. The Ingress controller is responsible for configuring these external load balancers to route traffic to the appropriate pods and services inside the cluster.

5. 𝐓𝐋𝐒/𝐒𝐒𝐋 𝐓𝐞𝐫𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: For HTTPS traffic, you can configure TLS/SSL certificates in the Ingress resource to enable secure connections.

*Ingress Controller Selection:*

There are several Ingress controllers available, and the choice depends on your requirements, such as Nginx Ingress for robustness, Traefik for flexibility, or GKE Ingress for Google K8S Engine users.
